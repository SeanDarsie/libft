The first project that every student that attends the 42 coding school must complete either in Paris or Silicon Valley.
Library of useful functions written in C

This library contains many of the functions provided by the string.h and a some extra that are not found there. 
For instance get_next_line.c is a function written to return text from a file one line at a time. 

This is the first big project I have written in the C language. I learned a lot about the language writing this library, though it's not especially useful as a library since it is a recreation of already available C library functions, it was a fantastic way to discover the capabilities and the limits of the C language.
